This is a readme file to access the codes.

Important note: I have used NS3-3.36.1 variant and its compiler only supports './ns3 run' instead of './waf run' , but I believe the code is backward compatible with waf compilers. 

ee597_lab1_E1.cc contains the code where you can switch between case A and B but for E1 subcase. You  have the flexibility to switch different no of nodes and see a pcap file for each run, being stored in the same folder as the build file. 

ee597_lab2_E2.cc contains the code for E2 case where you can switch between cases A and B. You  have the flexibility to switch different R values and see a pcap file for each run, being stored in the same folder as the build file. 

The respective directories that I have attached with the code files contains all the pcap files for the cases that I have run. 

Please visit the EE597_Lab1_Ns3_Report for a detailed report about the simulations.
